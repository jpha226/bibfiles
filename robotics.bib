The learned model can be used to compute the update policy search distribution for the REPS optimization. Models are only used locally and a new model is learned at each step from new samples. A lower bound of the search distribution entropy is introduced to prevent premature convergence. The surrogate objective is a quadratic approximation to the task. Because a quadratic representation has a lot of parameters dimensionality reduction is applied to the parameters before being passed through the quadratic basis functions. Advantages of this approach are noise in the objective function is smoothed out, more efficient than sample-based approximations to the KL-Divergence constraint in the REPS optimization. Experiments optimize two functions, two planar robotic tasks, and a simulated robotic beer pong task. The presented algorithm, MORE (Model-based relative entropy stochastic search), outperforms REPS, CMA-ES, POWER, and NES.}

	year={2010},
	booktitle={IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, ICRA},
	annote={This paper introduces two semi-parameteric methods for learning inverse dynamics (what action to take for a certain effect). A rigid body dynamics model (RBD) and a structured error term make up a robot's dynamics. The RBD term is known to be linear in the model parameters which are not straightforward to learn from data. Parametric methods also can't capture the structured error term which introduces bias into the estimation of the parameters. Non-parametric methods can do better here but most approaches attempt to learn from scratch which doesn't take prior model knowledge into account as parametric methods do. Also if data sets are small the non-parametric methods won't generalize well. The two methods presented here use a parametric estimate of the RBD model as a prior for a non-parametric GP estimate of the inverse dynamics. The two methods are to 1) use the RBD model as the mean of the GP or 2) use the RBD in the kernel function. Experimental evaluation is done with robotic tracking problems.}

	annote={This paper introduces a recurrent architecture for learning dynamics models where dynamics vary with time. The learned models are fast enough for real-time model predictive control (MPC). The result is a DeepMPC controller for food cutting tasks. They also propose a multi-stage pre-training algorithm for their architecture and evaluate it experimentally. Learned latent features capture material properties and variations. The task is linear cutting which involves applying force in two cartesian directions. MPC uses a differentiable model (like a neural network model) to find optimal controls for some cost. The pre-training involves unsupervised learning followed by short term prediction training, followed by a warm start recurrent training. Experiments are conducted on a PR-2 robot and parallelization allows for real-time speeds. Experiments show the predictive power of the model and ability to be used for MPC. The controller is able to handle a variety of different food materials in a cutting task.}

	volume={abs/1509.06791},
	year={2015},
	annote={This paper aims to use model predictive control to as a guiding policy for guided policy search with autonomous aerial vehicles. MPC generates training data using full state observations. Then a neural network is trained on a partially observable version of this data to learn good policies for test time. In other words the neural network has different inputs than MPC but will still know the correct action. The second benefit of this is that MPC is computationally demanding but NNs are efficient. Work is demonstrated on quadrotor obstacle avoidance tasks in simulation. Model free learning during training could result in catastrophic failure. This is why MPC has to be used. Offline optimization generates a guiding trajectory and then MPC is used to track this trajectory during training. This is because MPC usually uses a short planning horizon while a longer horizon is needed to complete certain tasks. Experimental results evaluate different components of the system. One of the key ideas is the instrumented training setup where full state information is supplied at training time and then only on board sensors are used at test time.}

This is in line with other science where models are developed in order to make predictions. However a model must be tested in the real world to confirm its validity. A simulator should be viewed as a complex mathematical model and results are predictions for how things will work in the real world. In some cases the simulator plays the role of "the system under study" which is not the case since it is simply a substitute for the robot. Basically, simulation experiments should be viewed as making predictions with a model - not actually doing an experiment.}

This is so the robot can respond to rapid changes in direction or deal with stepping on obstacles or being pushed. The controller is modelled as an inverted pendulum and is learned in simulation. Q-learning is used in the simulator to learn the policy. The robot's actions are ankle joint actuations (ankle tilt) which are used to control the pendulum's pivot point by moving the foot's center of pressure. The foot is discretized into toe, center, and heel. Actions are discretized as well and the reward function is set arbitarily with the goal of keeping the robot balanced and upright. The physical robots walk by using inverse kinematics to keep the center of mass at a constant height. On the real robot a kalman filter is used to estimate the state. Results show that ankle control is enough for the robot to remain balanced.}

	journal={Nature},
	annote={This paper considers how damaged robots can quickly find new behaviors to compensate for the damage. The method is called Intelligent Trial and Error (IT+E). It involves the robot building a behavior-performance map before being deployed. A behavior is a low dimensional representation of policies that the robot could use. The learned map identifies high performing behaviors. The map can be learned in simulation just once. Since these behaviors have not been executed on the real system the robot will have low confidence in them. After deployment if the robot's performance drops below a threshold (e.g. robot is damaged) it can select a new behavior from the map and execute that. As behaviors are executed on the robot the behavior performance and confidence in that belief can be updated accordingly. This is implemented with a Gaussian process and new behaviors are selected by maximizing information acquisition that balances exploration and exploitation. The algorithm is evaluated on a Hexapod robot and experiments show it can adapt in a small number of trials. It is noted that prior knowledge could hinder the robot from learning a new behavior depending on the type of damage or differences in simulation and reality}

Experimental results in simulation and on a physical robot show this can speed up learning. However in the case that the simulator is too unaccurate the prior may bias the simulator away from good policies and slow down learning. The method takes approximately twice the computation time of regular PILCO but it does not go up with the size of the simulated data set. It goes up with realworld data.}

The main contribution is showing that previous work can scale up with no pre-specified model or policy structure. The task is rotation of a cylinder 90 degrees in the hand. In one instance the start and end pose required gravity to be overcome and in one gravity can be used. Results are gathered in simulation and on the physical system. Not surprisingly results are better in simulation. They also study how injecting exploration noise and initial state noise can improve robustness. Results show that some noise increases robustness.}

	journal={arXiv},
	annote={This work combined model predictive control with an optimistic dynamics model. The work uses a feature-based representation of the robots dynamics (high level robot morphology) that allows the model to be fit efficiently with a least-squares procedure. This leads to online system identification using prior knowledge of the robot's joint and connectivity and physics. Optimisim driven control causes MPC to move the robot towards the goal or learn something new about the dynamics. The method works by executing a random control and appending the resulting position and derivatives to the sample list. Then the dynamics are estimated and optimistic dynamics constructed. The optimistic dynamics are used to plan a trajectory and the first action on this trajectory is executed. This process repeats until the task completes. The paper shows how linear regression can be used to fit the dynamics for online model identification. The control algorithm used for MPC is iLQR (a differential dynamic programming method). The experimental tasks involve moving an arm to certain positions which this method can do. These results indicate that dynamics models can be learned on line while completing a task. The method is comparable with DDP and fully-known dynamics.}

This model can be learned from previous different tasks. This model can be adapted online to lead to quick learning. Model predictive control is used to choose actions but this requires a model of the dynamics. The prior knowledge is used to learn local and more accurate models. The paper shows how a neural network dynamics model can be used to determine a prior for the dynamics. Also of interest to me is that their dynamics model is learning to predict acceleration which is then integrated to get the next state. The networks are trained on the ability to predict the next state but they have this extra step. The method is empirically evaluated and shown that is can solve tasks in one trial. The prior dynamics model was trained with recorded data from previous work. Also, good to note that one-shot learning is not instantaneous solutions to the task. Some exploration will still occur but the task will be solved in one trial (always less than 20 seconds). One limitation is that there must be access to a full Markov state for MPC.}

	journal={arXiv},
	annote={This paper looks at automatically learning a state representation from raw images using autoencoders. This work builds off of the GPS with CNN policies paper from Levine et. al. However, training the CNNs involved defining a state space for training linear gaussian controllers. This paper skips that step by learning the representation before training the controllers. As usual in Sergey's GPS work controllers are combined into a neural network policy. The method works by first having the robot attempt the task using a state space that only includes the robot configuration and joint velocity and accelerations. Since the tasks involve object manipulation the robot cannot learn the task. The resulting controller is then used as an exploration policy and images are recorded. An autoencoder is trained with the images to produce a bottleneck feature vector. Of importance is that the autoencoder is trained in a way that the final feature vector encodes object positions instead of semantic value. A term is added to the loss function to encode smoothness of feature points over images (for predicting dynamics). The learned features are then added to robot state information to form the final state representation. GPS is then used with this state representation to learn controllers for the task. The method is compared with different autoencoder architectures and it is shown that it performs with much less error.}

	annote={This paper uses Guided Policy Search under unknown dynamics for multi-step tasks. This task is hard because the performance of each controller determines the start state distribution for the following controller. For each forward controller learned a corresponding reset controller is also learned. This allows the robot to reset itself during training which reduces human intervention. The reset is not always trivial (i.e. move to a certain point). The reset controller will not always reach the desired start state which makes the task non-stationary for the forward controller. However, the GPS under unknown dynamics algorithm does not need the task to be stationary since it does not make this assumption. Samples from the controllers are used to train a neural network policy for generalization. Experimental results show the method works for combining controllers.}

	annote={A lot of the math in this paper was not very intuitive to me and it had a lot of math. The main takeaway was that the trajectory chosen for identification experiments is important for being able to quickly determine model parameters for non-linear dynamical systems. Mathematically, the convergence rate / noise immunity decreases as the persistent excitation matrix condition number increases. Noise sensitivity limits the largest eigenvalue of this matrix and the convergence rate is set by the smalleest eigenvalue. Finding a trajectory that optimizes convergence rate also optimizes noise immunity. Also noted that the identification is most noise sensitive in direction that the matrix is poorly conditioned. Finally, intuitive identification trajectories may in face be poorly conditioned.}

	journal={Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research},
	annote={This paper presents a two part algorithm (Confidence-Based Autonomy or CBA) for robotic task learning. The robot receives a demonstration and learns a policy through classification. The robot then executes this policy as long as its confidence in the action is high enough (e.g. for a GMM how far the state is from the action's mean). If confidence is too low the robot requests a demonstration. This way the robot receives demonstrations for areas in which it needs more data. The teacher can also interupt the robot and make corrections when the robot performs something wrong. This work is similar to DAgger but the teacher only demonstrates when the robot asks instead of randomly. One assumption is that the problem is one that can be paused for the robot (e.g. a video game or non-dynamic task). Empirical results are given in the car driving domain with GMMs as the supervised learning method.}

The structure of the net is learned with MCMC and then parameters are estimated. This BN encodes the relations between actions and sensors and sensors show actions effects on object. This knowledge is task independent. For a new task the robot uses Bayesian inverse reinforcement learning to learn the reward structure of the task.

The learned models don't have human units but are internally consistent. Some of the assumptions made are that the set of possible states is one-dimensional continuous, the agent has only one sensor, the agent can take a continuum of actions, and actions / sensor readings are perturbed by zero-mean random noise. Also each sensation maps to a specific state (i.e. no state aliasing). The paper shows how to learn one model given the other using polynomial regression. Then they learn both models together with weighted regression (more recent data has more weight). To prevent the models from diverging, the action model is updated towards the sensor model at each time step. The method requires an initial coarse action model. Experiments are done with an Aibo walking towards a beacon that demonstrate the methods works.}

	booktitle={Neural and Information Processing Systems, NIPS},
	annote={This paper presents guided policy search without a differentiable dynamics model. Instead of learning a global dynamics model, this method involves learning locally valid models. This helps with non-smooth dynamics that are hard to model globally. This creates a hybrid model-based model free reinforcement learning approach. The algorithm optimizes linear Gaussian controllers to find a locally optimal controller. The optimization problem maximizes the entropy of the controller which gives a wide distribution of states where the controller is valid. New controllers are computed iteratively with a KL-divergence constraint which guarantees that the new controller will not stray too far from the previous controller. The previous dynamics model is used as a prior on the next iterations dynamics model. A Gaussian mixture model is fitted to samples and this is used to compute the prior. Multiple controllers can be learned in this fashion and then combined into a neural network controller as demonstrated in prior GPS work. Experimental evaluation against PILCO, REPS, and others shows that this method is superior and the neural network aids generalization.}

	annote={This paper extends the E-Graph paper(below) by allowing the robot to build its graph from demonstration data. Also instead of just pose changes the new approach can handle manipulating objects along a one dimensional manifold. An E-Graph is a graph of previously explored plans which allows for faster search by penalizing the search from leaving the E-Graph (exploring the state space outside the graph). The modification to add demonstrations considers that the demonstration may not be in the original graph and the state space must have variables describing the object added to it. The latter is why the method is limited to only one dimensional manipulation because the state space is exponential in the number of dimensions. The paper introduces a new heuristic for the solution search that takes the manipulation into account. The method can handle suboptimal demonstrations because the planner will use what it can of the demonstration and find new paths for the suboptimal part. This allows for more than just replaying the demonstration.}

	annote={This paper introduces experience graphs (E-Graphs) for speeding up planning in robotics search problems. An E-Graph biases A* search towards edges that are already part of the graph. This allows robots to create plans faster by reusing prior knowledge. The approach in this paper builds the E-Graph and takes advantage of it to solve tasks quicker. This formulation relies on environments being largely static although they don't have to be completely static. If the E-Graph cannot be completely used the method can easily return to searching the entire state space. A parameter defines how much weight the planner should give to staying on the experience graph. The method works in simple cartesian state spaces and used inverse kinematics to compute movement. For large state spaces they propose using demonstration to initialize the graph. One potential problem is the experience graph growing too large. Future work could look at how to prune the graph since a large graph would take a long time to search even if it is better than regular A* over the state space.}

	annote={This paper looks at segmenting a demonstration using changepoint detection and learning skill chains from each demonstration. The skill chains can then be merged into a skill tree. The algorithm also applies a suitable abstraction to each skill to reduce the state space for that skill. The abstraction comes from a provided abstraction library and helps in high dimensional spaces. Each skill that is abstracted has its own goal and initiation set (Skills are options from options framework). The value function for each skill can be approximated with a linear value function approximator. Changes in the value function can also be used as changepoints when segmenting the demonstration (i.e. the value function becomes too complex). Once skill chains have been created, segments with the same target can be merged. Starting at the top of the chains this merging happens down the chains until no more merging can happen. This guarantees the resulting tree structure. Experimental results are given in the Pinball domain and on a mobile robotic manipulator. An interesting result is that with options a task can be learned faster than with regular RL even if the options are not provided. An experiment with a robot sequencing existing controllers to produce its own demonstrations. The authors note that this method may require domain specific tuning. First method to automatically segment a demonstration for the purpose of building skills in the options framework.}

Given an observation of a human interacting with an object the robot can learn what the object is based on the interaction (e.g. the human sat on that object so it is a chair). After the object has been given a label in this way the algorithm pulls out visual features of the object and uses these to generalize to other objects (e.g. this also looks like a chair so it is a chair and can be sat on). The method relies on good prior knowledge and an activity recognition system. The image features can be fairly general and low level (SIFT, color, etc.) This method only works for objects with a clear activity associated with them. Experiments show the method generalizing over chairs and doorways.}

A constraint on the KL-divergence of the controllers and the policy ensures that the induced state distributions will be the same at the end of training.

Learning starts with a demonstration then uses a blackbox optimization approach (PI^2) to improve the DMP which was learned by immitation learning. Then the robot is able to predict the success of a task from statistics of sensory data. Motions are represented as DMPs and initial parameters are learned with imitation learning. Then PI^2 is used to further optimize the task. After the task is at a satisfying level of performance statistics are collected on what sensory data predicts success. The statistics are then used to predict success or failure. The method is evaluated on learning a pool shot and flipping a box with chop sticks. Learning takes place quickly which may be due to the small amount of parameters used to encode the task. The success/failure prediction stats are a good step towards sensorimotor learning.}

  annote={This paper surveys uses of reinforcement learning in robotics. The high level idea is to show how different reinforcement learning ideas apply to robotics domains (e.g. model-based vs model-free). It also highlights challenges for RL in robotics tasks. Some of these main challenges are noisy environments, partial observability, under modeling, and defining a reward function. The paper describes value function approaches vs policy search methods. Policy search methods usually scale better to robotics because local coverage of the state-space can be good enough while value function methods need total coverage. Function approximatin is introduced as one way to make value function tractable. The paper then goes into more detail on challenges such as curse of dimensionality, expensive real-world samples, under modeling and model uncertainty, and difficulty in specifying the reward function. The next section surveys work that tries to make learning tractable through good representations (e.g. neural networks, motor primitives). The section after that focuses on using prior knowledge such as learning from demonstration, directing exploration, or creating a hierarchy. The next section looks at using models to improve learning. This discusses methods for handling simulation bias and uncertainty. It also surveys successful model based methods. It also notes that having access to a simulator is similar to having a model. A case study is presented of learning a ball-in-cup task which goes through the design choices for applying RL to the task. The final section discusses open questions (automatic representation, generating reward functions, integrating with perception). It also suggests ways that RL research can be focused to help the field of robotics learning.}

The authors want this formulation to allow for blending of MPs for producing higher level behavior. So the formulation must allow sequential and parallel composition.

The MP formulation is a normal distribution with mean defined by a linear basis function with additive zero-mean gaussian noise. The authors describe how they adjust speed by using a phase variable as in DMPs. Different basis functions are used for rhythmic or stroke-based motions. Joints can be coupled through the covariance of the joints at each time-step. Learning from demonstration requires multiple trajectories in order to learn a distribution. Combination of ProMPs can be described with probabilistic operators. The paper also derives how to analytically find a controller from the learned ProMP. The ability to learn on robotics task is illustrated with several experiments using immitation learning (robot hockey, maraca shaking). Future work should look at ProMPs in a modular control architecture.}

Then the data signals are temporally aligned with dynamic time warping. Gaussian mixture regression is then used to encode a generalized data signal. A method of imitation performance is defined that measures similarity between desired position and a possible position. A metric of imitation than looks at how the candidate position matches the desired position across the different types of data. Constraints of the body and environment are provided and used as constraints on finding an optimal controller. The body constraints are represented as a time-varying Jacobian. Jacobian methods work well for solving the inverse kinematics problem. The controller can then be found analytically. Generalization comes from the use of relative position data. Also new constraints change the task and could be used to derive a new controller for a new task. Experiments are carried out on some simple pick and place and manipulation tasks.}

The problem with supervised learning with imitation learning is that if the learned policy makes a mistake it can get outside of the learned distribution and mistakes will continue to compound. Previous solutions to this problem learn non-stationary or stochastic policies. On the other hand, Dagger learns a stationary, deterministic policy. Dagger works by executing a mixed policy that is made by executing the expert policy with probability beta and the current iteration's policy with probability 1 - beta. Beta is decreased over iterations so the algorithm relies more on the learned policy as it can trust it more. The policy at each iteration is trained in a supervised fashion over all the data seen up to that point. Dagger is run for a fixed number of iterations and the best policy over all the iterations is the final policy. Theoretical results establish no regret guarantees for both infinite and finite samples.

	annote={This article surveys the field of robotic learning from demonstration (LfD). The main motivation for LfD is to allow non-expert robotics users as demonstration is an intuitive way to teach a new behavior. It is noted that demonstration learning is a subset of supervised learning. The survey is organized by breaking LfD down into two phases - gathering data and deriving a policy. For the first phase the design choices are the choice of demonstrator and the demonstration technique. Examples of the former are a human or robot teacher and examples of the latter are batch learning vs interactive learning. One issue in this first phase is correspondence which is the mapping between teacher and learner. This is composed of two mappings - from teacher to recording (recording mapping) and from recording to learner (embodiment). Several techniques for the demonstration are discussed including teleoperation, shadowing, external observation, sensors on teacher and mimicry. The second phase of LfD is concerned with deriving a policy from this data. Three main paradigms for this are mapping (learn observation to action mapping directly), system model (learn a model and then plan a policy), and plans (learn pre and post conditions for actions and form a plan). The direct mapping can be produced using classification or regression techniques and the provided demonstration data. The system model approach is more like traditional reinforcement learning. This requires hand engineered rewards or inverse reinforcement learning. The plan approach works best at a higher level and can allow better teacher-learner interaction. The article goes on to disccus limitations within the data set that can come from undemonstrated states (interaction and generalization help here) and poor quality data from suboptimal demonstrations. Finally, the article gives several directions for future work - learning state features, incorporating temporal data, handling execution failures, evaluation metrics, and multi-robot LfD.}

The REPS algorithm bounds the change in the trajectory distribution between consecutive updates in order to avoid too large of updates. Sample based REPS can have a lot of variance unless it makes multiple roll outs on the real system. In the experiments the upper level policy is a linear-Gausian model and the lower level policy is a Dynamic Motion Primitives. Real data is used for learning the forward models and estimating the context distribution. Expected reward is computed with the forward model. With forward models it is easy to execute trajectories in parallel so better estimate can be made. Artificial samples are also created by using the reward of a different context and the trajectory already ran. GPREPS is compared with Model Free REPS and PILCO (analytical solution but not contextual). The Model based methods were substantially faster (2 orders of magnitude). GPREPS also converged quickly in a contexual scenario.}

	annote={This paper views optimization of robotics control as a multi-objective problem. Simulator inaccuracies result in a trade-off between good solutions and transferable solutions. The goals are to find good transferrable controllers and minimize the number of interactions with the target system. To minimize transfers, a transferrability approximation method is introduced to measure transferrability of solutions that have not been transferred by looking at ones that have. Controller behavior is broken down into behavior features which makes it possible to compute a distance metric between behavior of different controlelrs. The objectives are then transferrability, fitness, and behavioral diversity (for exploration). The general algorithm is to evaluate controllers and compare to already transferred controllers. Controllers with high enough diversity are transferred to the real system. Then a Pareto-optimal multi objective evolutionary algorithm is applied. The final solution is taken from the set of transferable non-dominated solutions. The best compromise solution is the one closest to the ideal point of maximal transferrability and maximal fitness. Experimental results are given for a simple robot quadrupedal walking with sinusoidal controllers. NSGA-II is used as the evolutionary algorithm of choice. One experiment used a simulator and a better simulator. The other used the better simulator and a real robot. Results show that the method works but I'm not sure how impressive they are. (Interesting related work - mask parts of simulation that are inaccurate in noise. This causes robust controllers to evolve)}

Essentially empirical measurements are taken to determine a function that maps commands to joint positions. Then this model is approximately inverted using a piece-wise linear approximation to the desired trajectory. This is because the model is not invertible everywhere and when it is there can be infinitely many inverses. Experimental results show that this model allows an Aibo to better match desired trajectories than directly requesting the trajectory even taking into account the known lag. Future work needs to look at external forces being applied.}

	booktitle={Twelth International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems, AAMAS},
	annote={This paper introduces the Grounded Simulation Learning (GSL) framework for learning in simulation and transferring to a real robot. The basic idea is to iteratively modify the simulator to make it better match the performance of the physical robot. This approach allows for many trials to be ran in simulation and orders of magnitude fewer ran on the real robot. Without the grounding learning algorithms tend to overfit to the simulator's differences from realities. The five parts of the framework are 1) an imperfect simulator that can be modified, 2) A robot on which evaluations can be ran, 3) An explor robot routine, 4) a supervised learning algorithm to learn a model of states and actions on the real robot, and 5) an optimization algorithm for finding better parameters in simulation. In addition to the grounding, the framework can also exploit expert guidance of the optimization. In this paper the task is a Nao learning to walk faster (HTWK walk base). The optimization method is CMA-ES and the supervised learning algorithm is the M5P tree regression algorithm. For grounding, a function is learned that maps commands on the real robot to resulting joint positions. Then the resulting joint positions are used as commands (plus some smoothing) in simulation. Guidance was in the form of opening and closing different parameters. Result was a 25 percent increase in walk speed. Future work could look at improving how the simulator is grounded or automating the selection of parameters for further investigation.}

	title={Continuous Memory States for Partially Observed Robotic Control},
	year={2015},
	booktitle={arXiv},
	annote={This paper presents a method for learning policies with memory for robotics tasks. It extends the framework of guided policy search (GPS) to learn policies with memory. The policy is a RNN however it is trained as a feedforward network. This makes the network easier to train and avoids exploding or vanishing gradients. Experiments show that this is more effective than naively replacing the feedforward network policy with a LSTM policy. To reiterate what GPS does: trajectory optimization is used to produce training data for supervised learning of a neural network policy. At each time step the policy takes an action and modifies its memory state. The memory state is then part of the input to the policy at the next time step. The memory states are optimized in the trajectory optimization which lets them be used as input for learning the policy. This changes GPS from learning a reactive policy (pi(u_t|o_t)) to a policy conditioned on sequences of observations. The trajectory optimization determines actions to take and also what is the best "store" action for modifying the memory states. The hidden memory state is then part of the input to the policy. The store actions and hidden input make the policy equivalent to a RNN. The proposed approach is tested on simulated robotic tasks that require memory. The method is compared against GPS with a LSTM and GPS with a standard feedforward network. The proposed approach was able to perform better. I do wonder if they did something wrong in training the LSTM network.}

	title={Learning Contact-Rich Manipulation Skills with Guided Policy Search},
	year={2015},
	booktitle={International Conference on Robotics and Automation, ICRA},
	annote={This paper is on learning skills for tasks with complex dynamics (i.e. more than just moving the body and object in a particular trajectory). Typical policies are resticted to low dimensional representations but this work uses higher dimensional policy representations. Also standard dynamics methods struggle with tasks with significant force or dynamics components. This approach learns a set of trajectories using linear-Gaussian controllers and unifies them with a neural network policy using guided policy search (GPS). They also propose a method for generating samples from trajectory distributions to produce more samples for learning the policy. The robot learns linear-gaussian controllers for learning a trajectory distribution. Samples from these trajectories are then used to train a neural network policy. At each iteration the allowable step size between the old and new trajectory distributions is adaptively adjusted to allow the robot to learn quicker in some parts of the task. GPS requires that as the policy is learned the trajectories must be optimized to match the state distribution of the current policy. As long as the state distribution is the same for the policy and the trajectories they can use supervised learning. For the different experimental manipulation tasks they define a general cost function which encourages quickly getting the object close to the target and then placing the object precisely. They also penalize joint velocities and torques to produce smooth motion. Method is evaluated on placing rings onto pegs, putting a part into a toy airplane, stacking large lego blocks, screwing caps onto bottles, and inserting a shoe tree into a shoe. The number of samples to learn a good controller is 20-25 which is much better than previous work. A two hidden layer neural network is used to represent the policy and provide generalization.}

	annote={Introduces a method for representing uncertainty over articulation models and action selection for reducing that uncertainty. Probabilistic method that integrates visual observations with feedback from actions. This method maintains a distribution over articulation models and parameters. Interactive perception is the paradigm of using a robots manipulation capabilities to learn about the world. The main contributions are a particle filter approach to track uncertainty, a manipulation sensor model that updates model liklihood based on feedback from manipulations, and introduces an action selection method for efficiently reducing uncertainty. The posterior probability of a model depends on a visual sensor model, action sensor model, and prior over the models. The two action selection methods considered are a maximal reduction of entropy selection vs a maximal information gain approach (KL divergence between the current distribution and expected distribution post action). The information gain approach is shown to be more effective and is used in most of the experiments. A particle filter is used to approximate the joint distribution of each model and its parameters. Human demonstrations are used to initialize the particle filter. Experiments conducted using all four types of articulation model (prismatic, rigid, rotational, and free body). Visual fiducials are used to remove object recognition from pipeline. Experiments show that few actions are needed to converge on correct model. Future work would include expanding to more types of models and looking for the best action over more than one time step.}

	annote={Similar to DQN, use deep CNN as function approximator for learning a policy. In this case the end to end training is for robotics tasks. The policies map raw observations to motor torques. Novel CNN architecture for localizing points of interests (i.e. no pooling). The CNN represents a randomized policy where actions are chosen from a Gaussian with mean given by the CNN. CNN represents probability of actions conditioned on observations (image and raw joints). The algorithm uses guided policy search which incorporates supervised learning into policy search. Training data must come from policy's state distribution. This is done by using BADMM to optimize policy to match trajectories and trajectories to match the policy. At convergence they will have same state distribution. The policy is trained on observations (image and joints) but the trajectories are optimized with full state information. The joint configuration is used as raw input alongside the learned visual features. No attempt at deep learning from joints is made. Work is evaluated on several different simple robotics task (using a PR-2).}

	annote={This workshop paper looks at applying deep and recurrent neural networks to learn walking controllers for simple simulated robots. The idea is that these architectures could learn high level features of the task that would allow knowledge to be transferred to a similar task. Example given is learning to walk and then being able to walk on uneven ground using a control law such as balance. Guided Policy Search (GPS) is used to optimize the walking policy. The various neural network architectures are used as function approximators for the policy. The three architectures used were a one hidden layer and a two hidden layer MLP and a single hidden layer recurrent network with rectified linear units. No regularization was used. There were 10 training terrains. General results were that deep and recurrent networks performed better but not always. Two types of overfitting are analyzed. One is high level overfitting where the network learns a poor control law from a demonstration. The other type is overfitting the training examples. Both types are observed. Local optima are also a challenge for the deeper network and recurrent network. Overall the deep and recurrent architectures generalized a little better than the shallow model. Future work could look at new regularizers for control tasks or changing the objective function to a maximum liklihood objective.}

Using a neural network, this paper shows how to learn a trajectory or sequence of actions over time to produce a desired movement. One approach is to slow the robot down to control exact trajectories. In contrast, this paper runs the robot at the max frequency. The output of the neural network is a joint command for each of the leg joints. The input is the values of those joints for the previous ten timesteps and the value of those joints for the next ten time steps. The leg has three joints so a network is trained with 60 inputs and three outputs. This is compared to three 20 input networks for each joint. The single network performs better which indicates it exploits the additional information of the other joint values. The neural network degraded well when it received requests that were out of its range.}

	annote={Fixed size neural networks can be used to learn control of a non-linear plant. Problem with a neural network is that they can 'forget' old knowledge when learning new knowledge. Same problem can be found in human learning. Consolidation is the process of moving a learned task into long term memory if there is sufficient time between learning of an old and new task. This paper presents an approach to using consolidation with artificial neural networks to prevent forgetting and increase generalization. The basic idea is to use on-line learning with a small neural network. Than offline rehearsal is used to train a big neural network. The big network grows to prevent forgetting. It is not clear if this is done with cascade correlation or neuroevolution. Experimental results are given on a real robot with a very simple experiment. The robot had to learn to actuate one DOF a certain amount. Three trajectories were learned and then the network was tested on these three and two new ones. Results showed consolidation learning prevented forgetting and generalized to new tasks. However, I'm not sure how impressive these results are given the simple tasks. Interesting way of combining neurophysiology with robotics though.}

	annote={A high number of degrees of freedom on a robot can make learning motor skills hard because the search space is high dimensional. Complex robots often have redundancies and can be controlled in a lower dimensional space. Reducing the dimensionality can reduce the number of trials needed to learn a policy. Previous work learns the latent space and then learns the policy. This work learns both jointly using a EM framework. They use Probabilistic PCA (PPCA) to reduce to the latent space. A projection matrix is used to transform latent variables into the high dimensional action space. This projection matrix defines synergies in the action space so it leads to correlated exploration. Experimental results show that the algorithm (PEPPER) can learn inverse kinematics and a nao learns to stand on one leg in simulation. The policies are good and not very many iterations are needed. The number of latent dimensions is a parameter of the algorithm. Also the latent dimensions are specific to the task not the possible actions the robot could take.}

	annote={This paper presents an algorithm called CHAMP for online Bayesian changepoint detection. As I understand it, changepoint detection is when you have time series data and at some point the distribution from which a data point is drawn changes. Online changepoint detection is when the data must be processed in an online method. CHAMP is a general method but the focus of this paper is using it to detect changing articulation models. An articulation model represents how an objects motion can change (e.g. a door swings and then locks in place). CHAMP approximates model parameters to avoid explicit integration of candidate models. The algorithm is experimentally evaluated on time-series data with five change points where a change point is a change of variance for a Gaussian distribution. Then it is evaluated on learning changepoints in articulation models for real world objects. This work is useful for robots learning from demonstration data. This paper builds off of work by Fearnhead and Liu with three changes: Approximate model evidence, minimum length of segments (distance between changepoints), and adds the model to the definition of each particle.}
